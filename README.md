# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Recommendation
Final Year Project done from September 2021 to June 2022

**Project Summary:**

The project focuses on sentiment analysis of Amazon book reviews to provide personalized book recommendations to users. Since the data was not enough, we have used GoodReads data for sentiment analysis and recommendation. By analyzing customer reviews, the system aims to understand the sentiment behind the reviews and recommend books that align with the user's preferences. The project involves data collection from Amazon and Flipkart, data cleaning, preprocessing, feature extraction, sentiment analysis using machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and deep learning (LSTM, CNN) algorithms, and book recommendation based on collaborative filtering. The system provides recommendations such as the most recommended book in all genres, the most recommended book in each genre, similar books based on user input, and random suggestions.

**Tools/Packages Used:**
1. Python 3
2. Anaconda Distribution
3. Beautiful Soup
4. Scrapy Framework
5. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
6. Scikit-learn
7. Gensim
8. TensorFlow/Keras
9. Pandas
10. NumPy

The project leverages various Python libraries and frameworks for data scraping, preprocessing, machine learning, deep learning and data analysis tasks.
